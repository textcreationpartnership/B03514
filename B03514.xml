            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> ſent a Trumpeter into the City of <hi>Mentz,</hi> under pretence to ranſom ſome Priſoners of War, but in effect to deliver ſecretly ſome Letters to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary-General. The Trumpeter ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſaid place ſomewhat longer than was expected, the <hi>French</hi> General was very uneaſie about it, and ſent the Marqueſs <hi>de Villacart, Maiſtre de Camp</hi> of the Regiment of Horſe of <hi>Berry,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Carabines, and Nephew to Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſieur <hi>de Louvois,</hi> together with Monſieur <hi>Belleviere,</hi> Major of the Royal Regiment of Horſe, and Mr. <hi>Fellinier,</hi> Captain of a Troop of Horſe, towards the City, to try if they could hear any news of the ſaid Trumpeter; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily for them, they were all made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners by a Troop of Dragoons, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent by the Governour to go in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of a <hi>French</hi> Party, met theſe three abovementioned Officers on their return. At the Entrance of the Gate of the City they met the Trumpeter; and one of the Officers that was taken, told him in a great paſſion, That he was the cauſe of their being made Priſoners; and that they would not fail to get him to be hang'd, as ſoon as they were ſet at liberty. The Trumpeter did not like the Propoſals; and being beſides, a <hi>German,</hi> he thought it ſafeſt for him to return into the City; and going ſtraight to the Governour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with what had paſt. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Count <hi>Thungen,</hi> the Governor of the City, being extreamly ſurprized at it, ſent immediately for the Commiſſary-General, and asking him about the Letter,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175901:2"/>and the Commiſſary denying that ever he had received one the Governour ſent for Six <hi>Huſſares,</hi> who after having ſtript him of all his Cloathes to his very ſhirt, in the General's preſence ſeveral Letters of dangerous concerns were found about him, hidden in ſome ſecret places of his Body. It was plainly diſcovered by them, that he had betrayed to the <hi>French</hi> King all the Meaſures that were taken in the City; and that he was to ſet the City on fire, as ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> were come near to Bombard it. There was a Letter, found about him, writ by the <hi>French</hi> King's own hand; and another written by him to the <hi>French</hi> King; wherein he thanks him for the exact and regular payment of his Penſion, which has been Two hundred <hi>French Pistoles</hi> a Month: He tells him, that a great many are teady to aſiſt him in all his undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the <hi>French</hi> King's Service; and it is ſaid, he will in few days be put to the Rack, in order to diſcover the ſaid Traytors. He himſelf is put into Iron Chains, and an Expreſs is ſent to ſeize his Brother, who is Secretary to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; his own Secretary, who was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured with his Maſter, has ſince Poyſon'd himſelf in the Priſon. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor-General, Count <hi>Thungen,</hi> has ordered all his Goods to be ſeized at <hi>Coſtheim,</hi> where the ſaid Commiſſary did reſide, amongſt which, there was found a Trunk full of <hi>French</hi> money, and a ſilver Service. If this dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy had not been ſo opportunely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the City of <hi>Mentz,</hi> the taking of which coſt the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> ſo much pains, and the <hi>Germans</hi> ſo much Blood, had been now all in Aſhes.
